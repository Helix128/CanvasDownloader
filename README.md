<h1>Canvas Downloader</h1>
As the name implies, this is a tool made mostly thanks to my laziness when it comes to downloading <b>lots</b> of files for college <i>plus practicing API usage...</i><br>
By default it skips any file that isn't a .pdf or .docx but it's easy to change. 

<h2>How to use</h2>
Either compile it yourself (like you would your average C# project) or download a Release (https://github.com/Helix128/CanvasDownloader/releases).
<br>Once you open it, a command line tool will prompt you to paste your canvas institution name (e.g (https://INSTITUTION.instructure.com/))<br>After that, paste your Canvas API key, which you can get by going to<br> <b>Account</b>-><b>Settings</b>-><b>Approved integrations</b>-><b>New access token</b>
<br>Then just type whatever you want in <b>Purpose</b> and click <b>Generate Token</b>.
Copy and paste the token into the console window and once you hit enter it should begin downloading your files!
<br>Your files should be located at (AppDirectory)/Downloads/(Course Name)/...
